## Programming language

A way of giving instructions to a computer.

Like a Lego, you will use pieces to create algorithms, that is, to solve problems.

> ðŸ’¡ **Algorithm**: A logical and finite sequence of steps to solve a problem.

## Parts of a language

- Comments
- Variable declaration (const, let)
- Operators (assignment, concatenation, mathematical, logical)
- Data types (string, number, boolean)
- Data structures (functions, object, array)
- Flow control (if/else)
- Repetition structure (for, while)

# Problem-solving phases

Collect data
Process data (manipulate, change ...)
Present data

## Scope and variables:

- Global and local variables
- Constants

## Data types:

- Strings (text): "" '' ``
- Numbers: 2 1.4
- Boolean: true, false

# Operators

- Value assignment operators: =
- Containment operator: +
- Comparison operators: == != < > <= >=
- Spread operator: ...

## Data structures:

### Arrays:

- A list that contains any type of data
- Array methods: push, [find, forEach, filter] : HOF (Higher Order Functions)

### Objects:

- Attributes and methods
- Object creation and manipulation
- Object properties access

### Functions

- create, pass arguments
- execute
- arrow function / named function

# Repetition structure
- while

# Conditionals
- switch
- if/else

## Modules in Node.js:
- Importing modules (require, CommonJs)
- 'inquirer' library to create interactive prompts
- FS (File System)

## JSON
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
- JSON.parse() : transforms JSON to JS
- JSON.stringify(): transforms JS to JSON

## Asynchronous programming and Promises:
- Using asynchronous functions (async/await)

## Functional Requirement
 - Create Goals 
 - List Goals 
   - Completed Goals 
   - Open Goals 
 - Mark/Unmark Completed Goals 
 - Remove Goals 
 - Messaging Systems 
 - Persist Data
